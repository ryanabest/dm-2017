    <p>Giorgia is an acclaimed and award-winning <em><b>"Italian information designer living in New York"</b></em>.
      She co-founded the design firm <a href = "https://www.accurat.it/" target="_blank">Accurat</a>, co-wrote <a href = "http://www.dear-data.com/" target="_blank">Dear Data</a> with fellow data designer <a href = "http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/introduction" target="_blank">Stefanie Posavec</a>, and spearheads a humanistic approach to using and visualizing data. Her impressive résumé also includes a Doctorate of Design from Politecnico di Milano and a place in MoMA's permanent collection for her work with Dear Data.

    In her 2016 essay published in Print-Mag, Lupi outlines her approach to and philosophy of data design, which she calls <em><b>DATA HUMANISM</b></em>, which is her rejection of and response to the one-size-fits all, dumbing-down <em>"peak infographics"</em> movement in data visualization - tailor made for catchy headlines but lacking in true insight or nuance.
    <br><br><br>
    In contrast, <em>Data Humanism</em> stresses that in order for data to provide real value in our lives and in society, we have to move past a purely technical approach to data. It has to be thought of in its proper <b>context</b>, considered within its <b>personal</b> relationship with its subjects and audiences. This data must be <b>relatable</b> before we can find real value in it. Lupi stresses looking beyond numbers for the sake of numbers - if we let numbers and the specific technology around those numbers rule the conversation, we miss the big picture. Life is messy, nuanced, and complicated - and data is no different. If we think of data (and data visualization) in <em>this</em> context, we can better use it to become more <b>'humane'</b>, not (just) more efficient. Lupi's design philosophy, centered in <em>Data Humanism</em>, is characterized by:

    <div class = "humchars">
      <h1>Embracing Complexity and imperfection</h1>
      <blockquote>The phenomena that rule our world are by definition complex, multifaceted and mostly difficult to grasp, so why would anyone want to dumb them down to make crucial decisions or deliver important messages?</blockquote>
      <br><br>
      <blockquote>Let's just stop thinking data is perfect. It's not. Data is primarily human-made. 'Data-Driven' doesn't mean 'unmistakably true,' and it never did.</blockquote>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h1>Non-linear Storytelling</h1>
      <blockquote>...people can get happily lost exploring individual elements, minor tales and larger trends within the greater visualization, while being naturally invited to engage with the visual on deeper levels</blockquote>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h1>Slowing down</h1>
      <blockquote>Dense and unconventional data visualizations promote slowness - a particularly poignant goal to set in our era of ever-shortening attention spans. If we can create visuals that encourage careful reading and personal engagement, people will find more and more real value in data and in what it represents</blockquote>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h1>Pen & Paper</h1>
      <blockquote>Sketching with data...introduces novel ways of thinking, and leads to designs that are uniquely customized for the specific type of data and problems we are working with</blockquote>
      <br><br>
      <blockquote>...blindly throwing technology at the problem...often leads to results that are not only practically useless, but also deeply wrong, because prepackaged solutions are rarely able to frame problems that are difficult to define, let alone solve</blockquote>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h1>focus on personal context of data</h1>
      <blockquote>The more ubiquitous data becomes, the more we need to experiment with how to make it unique, contextual, intimate. The way we visualize it is cruical because it is the key to translating numbers into concepts we can relate to.</blockquote>
      <br><br>
      <blockquote>...we should actively add personal and contextual meaning to our tracking. We shouldn't expect an app to tell us something about ourselves without any active effort on our part; we have to actively engage in making sense of our own data in order to interpret those numbers according to our personal story, behaviors and routine</blockquote>
